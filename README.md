Summary:
--------
Protify is a daily protein tracker made for gym-goers and bodybuilders. It allows users to log foods quickly, set a daily protein goal based on their weight and training goals, and track how much protein they’ve had throughout the day in order to determine whether they are reaching their desired protein count or not.
